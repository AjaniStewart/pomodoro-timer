This is the pair programming project found on the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project?ref=lnav)

Although it was meant for two, I did it by myself. This repository implements the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), a method of time management. You can adjust the times, and use keyboard shortcuts. 

This was written in vanilla JavaScript, using no external libraries.

It is hosted [here](https://ajanistewart.github.io/pomodoro-timer/).
